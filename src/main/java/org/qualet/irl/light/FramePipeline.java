/**
 * The per-frame light orchestration. {@link #frame} runs at renderWorld HEAD,
 * before Iris activates: collect this frame's lights and bake spotlight/point
 * shadow maps. The camera-relative SSBO upload is split off into
 * {@link #uploadIfPending}, which the mixin invokes just after this frame's
 * {@code Camera.update} so the SSBO origin is the CURRENT-frame eye (uploading at
 * HEAD would use the stale previous-frame camera and make lights jerk on movement).
 * Both IRLite and IRL-redactor drive this identically; the per-mod
 * {@code GameRendererLightMixin} is a thin delegate that supplies the two
 * mod-specific seams (the shaders-off check and the light collect source), the
 * optional dormant hook, and the post-Camera.update {@link #uploadIfPending} call.
 *
 * <h2>Shaders-off gate</h2>
 * With no shaderpack active nothing consumes the SSBO or the shadow maps, so the
 * whole collect/bake/upload pipeline would be wasted work (the shadow bake being
 * the expensive part). The gate drops the render-path registrations that still
 * arrive each frame, releases the GPU-side state ONCE on the transition into the
 * dormant state, and stays dormant until a shaderpack returns. The gate is passed
 * as a {@link BooleanSupplier} rather than called here so the Iris dependency
 * stays out of the parts of the engine that do not need it.
