 *
 * TWO-LAYER bake: a light with a live entity/replay in range runs in OVERLAY
 * mode — its static content (model blocks + world blocks) is baked into a
 * separate STATIC tile only when that content changes, then each frame the
 * base is GPU-copied into the live tile and just the dynamic casters render on
 * top. Re-tessellating cutout blocks / re-rendering model-block form trees no
 * longer happens per frame, so the per-frame cost of an animated scene depends
 * on the moving subjects, not on the scenery around the lamp.
