/**
 * VRAM budgeting for the shadow stack — two levers:
 *
 * 1. APPLY-TIME CLAMP ({@link #chainBudgetBytes}): each atlas chain (point /
 *    spot) gets half of (free VRAM - reserve) at preset-apply time;
 *    {@code setTileSize} walks its power-of-two ladder down until the chain's
 *    unavoidable footprint fits. Before this clamp an ULTRA preset on a
 *    32768-limit card allocated 9.6 GiB at world join (2x 24576^2 depth
 *    atlases + full 30-lamp filter arrays) and left a 12 GiB card in
 *    permanent residency thrash.
 *
 * 2. PER-FRAME GROWTH APPROVAL ({@link #updatePointCaps}): the point filter
 *    arrays (pyramid + MSM) are demand-sized — allocated per tier, in chunks
 *    of {@link #CHUNK} blocks, only up to the highest block the allocator
 *    actually handed out. Each frame this class pre-approves at most one
 *    chunk of growth per tier against live free VRAM; ShadowBaker's
 *    acquire paths never hand out a block past the approved cap, so a
 *    filter flush can always allocate the layers behind every published
 *    block BEFORE the SSBO flush makes it sampleable. Denied growth simply
 *    shrinks the effective pool — lamps past it take the existing
 *    spare/unshadowed paths (graceful, no foreign-layer sampling).
 *
 * The rank->tier mapping (POINT_TIER_END) never changes with the caps (the
 * GLSL tier decode is a frozen ABI); only how many blocks of a tier are
 * physically backed does. All queries run on the render thread.
