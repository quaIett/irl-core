 * uploadEmpty that writes flags=0 so a shader that keeps the buffer bound reads a
 * dormant grid and falls back to the full loop. The snapshot is recorded during
 * {@link LightRegistry#flush} (camera-relative light positions), and projected to
 * tiles LATER, in {@link #buildAndUpload}, with the captured gbuffer matrices —
